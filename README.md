## Branch Conflict Resolution

Throughout the project, we regularly encountered merge conflicts in both code and the Unity scene. For code conflicts, we reviewed the changes together and resolved any discrepancies. In the Unity scene, we addressed issues like broken GameObject references by checking which objects caused the conflict and reattaching them as needed. After resolving conflicts, we merged the changes into the main branch to keep the project up-to-date and functional.
